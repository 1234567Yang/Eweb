## Usage

Chinese visual HTML development (friendly framework, you can change the language by yourself, English, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Vietnamese... As long as you have time and effort, you can change the language easily!)
You can directly click on the component to drag and drop
Form editing component style (similar to C++ Windows window design)
``` diff
+ Realize code-free front-end design, making a website with zero foundation is not a dream
+ Already supports form filling + nesting
```
It supports the adjustment of hierarchical relationship, which can realize the order of front and back.

Component self-positioning is supported.

Refactored all the default parameters, the framework is more perfect


**How to use it? **
<br>
**Actually, this usage is exactly the same as that of Easy Language (VB) components~**
<br><br>
**How to enter? **
<br>
Enter the software, first click on the window on the left to select, and then there is an editing window at the bottom of the screen (on the top of the output), just click it~
How to choose components?
Click on the window on the right, there is a super list box, click on the component you want (90% restore easy language component description, convenient~)
Click once, and then drag the mouse directly on the white baseboard. After the dragging is completed, a component will be added (currently it is directly and automatically positioned fixed, which is very convenient!)
Click on that component, and you will find that there is information in the property bar on the left, just change the information.

It is also very convenient to modify the background information~ click on the background part, a button will appear in the property bar, click to open a notepad, and just follow the prompts to change it.

** How to compile when done? **
There is a toolbar in the upper left corner, click compile-compile to HTML, if you want to see the code, select special compile-compile into readable HTML code
Then go to your running directory, there is AutoSave.html, that is the finished product compiled!
Just click on it to see the effect ~ or open it with Notepad to see the source code.
**Tips: Click on the hidden window in the upper right corner, and it will automatically ask you whether to compile before hiding~**
**In the future, I will post a video on bilibili (if I can’t post it, it will be on YouTube), introducing each component in detail. **

**Announcement - Long-term maintenance of the project! Big guys, where is your Star? **
